# Just for me :

Some of the exercises work on the same application. In these cases, it is sufficient to submit just the final version of the application. If you wish, you can make a commit after every finished exercise, but it is not mandatory.

Because of the above, I believe that in part 1, it shouldn't be neccesary to provide exercise 1.4 separately if you provide up to 1.5, since they are iteratively building on the same application.
