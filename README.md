# FullStack Open coursework for the public repo

Note for Mluukkai :

I was working on this course from my schools repository initially (which is closed source), but since there came a point where maintaining states of older repositories (the backend one combined with the "course" repo) became time consuming it was better to create the public repo now so that state could be seen from commit history instead.
Because of this, some of the further additions to certain code that was expanded upon in a later part is duplicated (so for example, in part3 we expand on what was done in part2. Part2 is left in its final state under part02, and it was recreated in part03 where it was further implemented upon).

I am still using the closed source repo, but I am moving over files under a submodule which points to this repository once a given part is finished.
